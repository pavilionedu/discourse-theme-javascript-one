title:       Loading Javascript from an external site
description: Loading javascript from an external site is typically handled in the
             ``head_tag.html`` and ``body_tag.html`` files. We've covered how those 
             files are inserted into the Discourse HTML in Unit 4. In this unit 
             we're going to take that to the next level by loading some scripts.

             We're going to use the library Clippy.js, a embeddable version of 
             the old Microsoft Word animated helper who took the form of a paper 
             clip, aka "Clippy". We'll be embedding Clippy in Discourse using 
             this library.
             
             ```
             https://github.com/smore-inc/clippy.js
             ```

             As we're focusing on loading external javascript here, we'll use 
             the CDN-hosted version of the Clippy.js assets described in this 
             re-write of the library. We'll look at loading the assets locally
             in our next unit.

             ```
             https://github.com/pi0/clippyjs#browser
             ```

             Copy the example code from the readme of the repo linked above and 
             paste it into the relevant files in this unit's theme. If you're 
             unsure of where it should go, go back over our discussion of the 
             HTML structure and theme files in Unit 4.

             When you've added the code and refreshed the page in your
             Theme Creator preview you should notice an error in your browser 
             console that starts with "Refused to load the script". Head over to
             ``body_tag.html`` and we'll discuss what that means and what to do
             about it.
