# title:        Working with Javascript (Part 1)
# description:  This is the first of three units about working with Javascript in 
#               Discourse themes. This is the fifth unit in the Discourse Theme 
#               Development course. Make sure you've completed all the previous
#               units in the course before starting this one.
#
#               In particular you should be familiar with concepts discussed in 
#               Unit 4, Working with HTML. If you haven't done that unit yet, or 
#               haven't done it recently, please go over that unit first. It's 
#               also worth going over the Javascript guides in the Theme 
#               Developer Quick Reference Guide to get a sense of the different
#               aspects of Discourse Javascript we'll be discussing in this and
#               subsequent units.
#
#               When you're ready to start, clone the unit theme listed in the 
#               references and start watching it on the Discourse Theme creator.

# title:        When do you work with Javascript?
# description:  There are a few reasons why you'd be working with javascript in 
#               a Discourse theme. We'll cover the first method in this unit,
#               and the other two in the following units. 
#
#               Firstly, you may be adding some embedded functionality where the
#               Javascript is loaded from an external source, and just needs to 
#               be linked and loaded correctly, or requires some minor local 
#               scripting. For an example of this, please have a look at at the 
#               Intercom Widget and Matomo Analytics theme components in the 
#               references. Go through the theme files of each. Based on what 
#               we've covered so far, both components should make some sense to
#               you. This is typically the easiest scripting you'll do as it
#               doesn't require you to understand how Discourse javascript is
#               structured.
#
#               Secondly, you may be modifying or extending some existing 
#               functionality in Discourse. You may want to change the way the 
#               "New Topic" button behaves for example. Check out the Expanded
#               Create Topic and New Topic Button components (in the references)
#               for examples of this. This kind of work requires you to understand 
#               a bit about how the Discourse javascript works and will involve 
#               the Discourse client-side javascript api.
#
#               Lastly, you may want to add your own entirely new functionality
#               within Discourse. The complexity of this can range significantly
#               from something relatively simple like the Category Banners 
#               component, to something complex like the Kanban Theme Component.
#               We'll cover this last.
#
#               If you're working from the repository, head over to 
#               ``head_tag.html``, where we'll get started on the first type.
