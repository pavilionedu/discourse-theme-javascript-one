# title:        Working with Javascript (Part 1)
# description:  This is the first of three units about working with Javascript in 
#               Discourse themes. This is the sixth unit in the Discourse Theme 
#               Development course. When you're ready to start, clone this unit 
#               theme and start watching it on the [Discourse Theme Creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org).

# title:        When do you work with Javascript?
# description:  There are a few reasons why you'd be working with javascript in 
#               a Discourse theme. We'll cover the first reason in this unit,
#               and the other two in the following units. 
#
#               Firstly, you may be adding some embedded functionality where the
#               Javascript is loaded from an external source, and just needs to 
#               be linked and loaded correctly, or requires some minor local 
#               scripting. For an example of this, have a look at at the 
#               Intercom Widget theme components. This is typically the easiest 
#               scripting you'll do as it doesn't require you to understand how 
#               Discourse javascript is structured.
#
#               Secondly, you may be modifying or extending some existing 
#               functionality in Discourse. You may want to change the way the 
#               "New Topic" button behaves for example. Check out the Expanded
#               Create Topic component for an example of this. This kind of work 
#               requires you to understand a bit about how the Discourse 
#               javascript works and will involve the Discourse client-side 
#               javascript api.
#
#               Lastly, you may want to add your own entirely new functionality
#               within Discourse. The complexity of this can range significantly
#               from something relatively simple like the Category Banners 
#               component, to something complex like the Kanban Theme Component.
#               We'll cover this last.
#
#               In many cases you'll be using multiple approaches at once, i.e. 
#               embedding, extending and adding, however we're going to be 
#               addressing each in turn through example cases to illustrate
#               some of the specific issues you might face in each case.
