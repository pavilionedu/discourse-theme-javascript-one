# title:        Working with Javascript (Part 1)
# description:  This is the first of three units about working with Javascript in 
#               Discourse themes. This is the sixth unit in the Discourse Theme 
#               Development course. When you're ready to start, clone this unit 
#               theme and start watching it on the [Discourse Theme Creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org).
#
#               ### When reading on Pavilion Education
#
#               If you're taking this unit on [Pavilion Education](https://education.thepavilion.io),
#               mark the ``self review`` steps ``Complete`` when you've completed 
#               them. If a step is marked ``peer review`` or ``teacher review`` 
#               post a comment on the step with your answer and click "Submit"
#               to notify your peers or teachers.
#
#               There's a video of a teacher completing the unit in the final 
#               step, which you'll be able to watch once all other steps are
#               complete.
#
#               ### When reading the code
#
#               If you're reading this in the unit theme code, the last step in 
#               a file will tell you where to go to find the next step (if there 
#               is one). If you can't find it, do a search for learning_step 
#               in the theme folder in your code editor to see all the steps in 
#               the unit. All units start in the START file and end in the 
#               FINISH file.

# title:        When do you work with Javascript?
# description:  There are a few reasons why you'd be working with javascript in 
#               a Discourse theme. We'll cover the first reason in this unit,
#               and the other two in the following units. 
#
#               Firstly, you may be adding some embedded functionality where the
#               Javascript is loaded from an external source, and just needs to 
#               be linked and loaded correctly, or requires some minor local 
#               scripting. For an example of this, have a look at at the 
#               Intercom Widget theme components. This is typically the easiest 
#               scripting you'll do as it doesn't require you to understand how 
#               Discourse javascript is structured.
#
#               Secondly, you may be modifying or extending some existing 
#               functionality in Discourse. You may want to change the way the 
#               "New Topic" button behaves for example. Check out the Expanded
#               Create Topic component for an example of this. This kind of work 
#               requires you to understand a bit about how the Discourse 
#               javascript works and will involve the Discourse client-side 
#               javascript api.
#
#               Lastly, you may want to add your own entirely new functionality
#               within Discourse. The complexity of this can range significantly
#               from something relatively simple like the Category Banners 
#               component, to something complex like the Kanban Theme Component.
#               We'll cover this last.
#
#               In many cases you'll be using multiple approaches at once, i.e. 
#               embedding, extending and adding, however we're going to be 
#               addressing each in turn through example cases to illustrate
#               some of the specific issues you might face in each case.
